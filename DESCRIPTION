Description: MS2Quant harvests pre-trained xgbTree algorithm-based ionization efficiency prediction model. Using strucutral information (SMILES) or predicted fingerprints calculated with SIRIUS+CSI_FingerID software, ionization efficiency can be predicted. If calibrants have been measured together with suspects subject to quantification, predicted ionization efficiencies can be converted into measurement-specific response factors and concentration of unknown chemcals can be estimated.
